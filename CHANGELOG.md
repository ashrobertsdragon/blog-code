### Changed

- **Frontend**: Updated entry point from `main.jsx` to `main.tsx` in `index.html`.
- **Frontend**: Updated tests to correctly expect `React.StrictMode` as `symbol` type (React 18 behavior).

### Fixed

- **Code Review Fixes (PR #7)**: Implemented fixes from sourcery-ai and gemini-code-assist code reviews

  - **Build Script**: Enhanced shell safety flags in `scripts/build.sh`
    - Added `set -u` to error on unset variables
    - Added `set -o pipefail` to catch errors in pipelines
    - Removed unnecessary `exit 0` that could hide non-zero exit codes
    - Changed `npm install` to `npm ci` for faster, more reliable builds from lockfile
  - **E2E Tests**: Improved test reliability and production configuration
    - Fixed build fixture to always run build for test determinism
    - Added `try...finally` block to ensure cleanup even if tests fail
    - Track initial BUILD_DIR state to preserve pre-existing builds
    - Changed FLASK_ENV from DEVELOPMENT to PRODUCTION to accurately test production stack
    - Marked GitHub health check test with `@pytest.mark.external` to allow skipping in offline/restricted environments
  - **BATS Tests**: Optimized build script test performance
    - Refactored to use `setup_file()`/`teardown_file()` hooks
    - Build script now runs once per test file instead of once per test (4x faster)
    - Individual tests now only verify build artifacts exist

- **Deployment**: Critical bug fix in error handling for deployment script

  - Fixed `uapi_call()` function to correctly capture and propagate command exit codes
  - Previously, `if ! command; then` pattern was causing `$?` to be 0 (success of if-test negation) instead of the actual command failure code
  - Changed to explicitly capture exit status before testing: `command; exit_status=$?; if [[ $exit_status -ne 0 ]]; then`
  - This ensures deployment aborts immediately when UAPI operations fail instead of continuing silently
  - Added comprehensive error checking (`|| return 1`) to all deployment functions for fail-fast behavior
  - Fixed tests 12, 13, and 14 which were failing assertions but not executing
  - Test 12: Added `stat` mock for SSH key permission verification
  - Tests 13-14: Added proper UAPI mocks that handle different operations independently

- **Frontend**: Updated frontend dependencies to latest versions.

- **Frontend**: Corrected Biome configuration to remove redundant include paths.

- **Frontend**: Separated Vitest configuration into `vitest.config.ts` and ensured shared configuration with `vite.config.ts` using `mergeConfig`.

## v0.1.2 (2025-11-17)

### Fixed

- **CI**: Fixed frontend CI build failure by updating `vitest` to `^4.0.9` and adding `@vitest/coverage-v8`.

## v0.1.1 (2025-11-14)

### Refactor

- Refactored `config.py` to introduce `get_db_url()` for obtaining the database connection string, replacing direct instantiation of `DBSettings`.
- Updated tests in `test_config.py` to reflect the refactoring and added tests for `get_db_url()`.

### Fixed

#### Code Review Fixes (PR #2)

- **Critical**: Fixed datetime field defaults in `User` and `Post` models
  - Changed `Field(default=datetime.now(dt.UTC))` to `Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(dt.UTC))`
  - Prevents all records from sharing the same import-time timestamp
  - Files: `backend/src/infrastructure/persistence/models.py` (lines 13, 27-28)
