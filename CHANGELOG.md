### Changed

- **Frontend**: Updated entry point from `main.jsx` to `main.tsx` in `index.html`.

### Fixed

- **Frontend**: Updated frontend dependencies to latest versions.
- **Frontend**: Corrected Biome configuration to remove redundant include paths.
- **Frontend**: Separated Vitest configuration into `vitest.config.ts` and ensured shared configuration with `vite.config.ts` using `mergeConfig`.

## v0.1.2 (2025-11-17)

### Fixed

- **CI**: Fixed frontend CI build failure by updating `vitest` to `^4.0.9` and adding `@vitest/coverage-v8`.

## v0.1.1 (2025-11-14)

### Refactor

- Refactored `config.py` to introduce `get_db_url()` for obtaining the database connection string, replacing direct instantiation of `DBSettings`.
- Updated tests in `test_config.py` to reflect the refactoring and added tests for `get_db_url()`.
