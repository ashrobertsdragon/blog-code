"""Integration tests for SPA routing behavior.

Tests Flask's ability to serve React SPA with proper routing:
- Serve index.html for client-side routes (non-API, non-static)
- Preserve API routes from SPA catch-all
- Serve static files directly from build/static/
- Handle missing index.html gracefully

These tests follow TDD RED phase - they WILL FAIL until implementation exists.
